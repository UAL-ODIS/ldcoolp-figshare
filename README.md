## Overview

`ldcoolp-figshare` is a command-line API used in
[`LD-Cool-P`](https://github.com/UAL-ODIS/LD_Cool_P) to interact with the
[Figshare API](https://api.figshare.com). It is used by
[ReDATA](https://arizona.figshare.com) data curators for the curation of
submitted research data products. This codebase is generalized such that
other curators with a
[Figshare for Institution](https://knowledge.figshare.com/institutions)
instance can use.

## Getting Started

You will need Python. We recommend v3.9.
This code will be tested with v3.7, v3.8, and v3.9.

This code will be published as `ldcoolp-figshare` on PyPI. Thus, the
simplest installation will be:
```
pip install ldcoolp-figshare
```

### Requirements

All requirements will be given in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)
