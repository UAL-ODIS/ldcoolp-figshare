Overview
--------

``ldcoolp-figshare`` is a command-line API used in `LD-Cool-P`_ to
interact with the `Figshare API`_. It is used by `ReDATA`_ data curators
for the curation of submitted research data products. This codebase is
generalized such that other curators with a `Figshare for Institution`_
instance can use.
